Processed 2 paths with a state count of 103
State graph built. Appending cycles where allowable.
Added 103 cycles, with 1 new states and 4 transitions.
Removed 0 dead-end states and 0 probability sink states (total 0 states).
Removed 0 corresponding transitions.

BEGIN ERROR CHECKING
If an inconsistency is found in the state space, its details will be provided here.
Otherwise, assume the generated state-space is error-free.
This is an added confidence booster for the probability results.
