\section{Summary}

For a CTMC model \model\, assume the following transient CSL property
\cslEventually\ is of interest. This framework aims at efficiently
providing the estimated lower and upper probability bound,
\ensuremath{\probOp_{min}} and \ensuremath{\probOp_{max}}, for the path 
formula \eventually, respectively. The proposed method is expected
to work well for highly concurrent CTMC models such as genetic circuit
models an chemical reaction network models.
