Processed 2 paths with a state count of 102
State graph built. Appending cycles where allowable.
Added 52 cycles, with 2 new states and 5 transitions.
Removed 1 dead-end states and 1 probability sink states (total 2 states).
Removed 3 corresponding transitions.
Average ratio among removed states was 0.9808 (min 0.9808 and max 0.9808).
User-provided tolerance was 0.9500

Final Count:
102 states
250 transitions

BEGIN ERROR CHECKING
If an inconsistency is found in the state space, its details will be provided here.
Otherwise, assume the generated state-space is error-free.
This is an added confidence booster for the probability results.
