Processed 2 paths with a state count of 106
State graph built. Appending cycles where allowable.
Added 54 cycles, with 2 new states and 5 transitions.
Removed 1 dead-end states and 1 probability sink states (total 2 states).
Removed 3 corresponding transitions.
Average ratio among removed states was 0.9812 (min 0.9812 and max 0.9812).
User-provided tolerance was 0.9300

Final Count:
106 states
260 transitions

BEGIN ERROR CHECKING
If an inconsistency is found in the state space, its details will be provided here.
Otherwise, assume the generated state-space is error-free.
This is an added confidence booster for the probability results.
