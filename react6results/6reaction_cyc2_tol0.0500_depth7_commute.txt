State graph built. Appending cycles where allowable.
Added 58 cycles, with 2 new states and 5 transitions.
Removed 2 dead-end states and 2 probability sink states (total 4 states).
Removed 6 corresponding transitions.
Average ratio among removed states was 0.7637 (min 0.5455 and max 0.9819).
User-provided tolerance was 0.0500

Final Count:
112 states
277 transitions

BEGIN ERROR CHECKING
If an inconsistency is found in the state space, its details will be provided here.
Otherwise, assume the generated state-space is error-free.
This is an added confidence booster for the probability results.
