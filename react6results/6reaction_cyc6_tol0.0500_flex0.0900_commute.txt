Processed 2 paths with a state count of 160
State graph built. Appending cycles where allowable.
Added 0 cycles, with 0 new states and 0 transitions.
Removed 2 dead-end states and 0 probability sink states (total 2 states).
Removed 2 corresponding transitions.

Final Count:

BEGIN ERROR CHECKING
If an inconsistency is found in the state space, its details will be provided here.
Otherwise, assume the generated state-space is error-free.
This is an added confidence booster for the probability results.
