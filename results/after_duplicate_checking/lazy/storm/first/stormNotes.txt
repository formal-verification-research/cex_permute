Notes about checking with STORM:

- Need to annotate every target state when the label file is generated
- Need to have absorbing state (or at least one state) transition back to itself
- What if we use 1 - the probability of absorbing state to get overapproximation
- Need to find out how to annotate the target state and initial state (0=init?)
- STORM command that worked: storm --explicit buildModel.tra buildModel.lab --prop 'P=? [F "absorb"]'
